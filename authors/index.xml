      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a senior actuarial analyst at Hiscox. I currently work within the group reserving team focusing on US liability classes of business. Outside of this role, I am interested in software development, which in the work context would generally imply using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SQL&lt;/code&gt;. As a challenge (or perhaps for a distraction) I decided to build this website, partially to archive some personal thoughts as well as using this as an opportunity to develop some new skills. It also serves as a 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://agarbiak.github.io/project/blender/&#34;&gt;showcase&lt;/a&gt; for some of my terrible creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my personal website and is not associated with Hiscox. As such all views and opinions expressed are my own and do not reflect those of my employer.&lt;/p&gt;

The feature image was created using Blender\u0026rsquo;s sculpting workflow and some nice shading techniques to create the sclera cornea and iris. I\u0026rsquo;ll be adding some more Blender renders over this month. This has taken up much more time than anticipated so I\u0026rsquo;m currently putting on hold the below development work.\r\r\rSummary of ideas Working on a few things \u0026hellip; thought about what development1 I could work on next:\n A .csv parser A share option investment review web page, working title \u0026ldquo;Are we in the money?\u0026rdquo; Some JavaScript to download all files from a selected SharePoint site  All output will be posted as an open source solution on GitHub with a MIT license (essentially attribution is required in your source code if you use it).2\nThe .csv parser My idea is to perform some simple parsing checks on a potential .csv file that needs to meet a set criteria. Examples:\n Date field - needs to be in the form yyyy-mm-dd, so:  23/05/2020 as user entry by default would fail, and thus would be parsed as 2020-05-23, additionally 43974 (which is Excel\u0026rsquo;s serial numeric representation3 of the date 23rd May 2020) would fail, and again be parsed as 2020-05-23   Location code field - needs to have a length of 5 characters, so:  LON00 is acceptable, even though the entry in the database is stored as LON, whereas LON would fail and therefore would be parsed as LON00   Amount field - needs to be in the form xxxxxx.xx, i.e.:  £10.00 would fail due to the inclusion of a currency symbol character and therefore would be parsed as 10.00, 1,234,567.00 would fail due to the inclusion of a comma separating the thousands and therefore would be parsed as 1234567.00, 1000 would fail due to the omission of the two decimal points and therefore would be parsed as 1000.00, 1.000,55 would fail due to the usage of European numeric format (decimals are used as thousand separators, commas are used for decimal points) - this would be parsed as 1000.55    This idea would alleviate the onerous requirement on the end user to match an arbitrary specification. Instead the code would transform the .csv into the required format for processing in another process or storage in a database.\n💰 Are we in the money? 🤑 This will be a share saving scheme performance review web application which will show:\n Current share price, $\\mathbf{S}_{t}$ Strike price, $\\mathbf{K}_{t=0}$ Grant date, $\\mathbf{t}=0$ Vesting date, $\\mathbf{T}$, giving days until vested of $\\mathbf{T}-\\mathbf{t}$ Are we in the money? Yes or no - simple function call Max$(0, \\mathbf{S}_{t} - \\mathbf{K})$ Absolute (£) and relative (%) return based on current share price Annualised return based on time $t$ between the current date $t$ and grant date $0$ Outperformance versus broad index, perhaps FTSE 100 or S\u0026amp;P 500 Use some Brownian motion to predict the share price at time $\\mathbf{T}$  Downloading all files from SharePoint using JavaScript A simple (I hope) JavaScript file that will download all files from a selected SharePoint directory into a user-specified network directory.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the need for this? The SharePoint site I use only allows a user to individually click on a file, click the context menu (to activate the drop down options), before finally being able to click on download. That\u0026rsquo;s three clicks on top of mouse cursor movement. Not too bad for one file, what about doing this for 100 files?\nSo this simple application will create some efficiency. Of course because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to code JavaScript it will take me longer to write this than manually clicking and pointing 300 times ($3$ clicks x $100$ files).\n  Feel free to interchange the word \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo; with coding, programming, whatever term you want. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Please note this statement is not to be construed as legal advice and is strictly my interpretation (my opinion).

Quizzes are easy to create but hard to be fun. So here goes my attempt at building a pub quiz application using JavaScript so I can host it on my own website.\n\rWhy a pub quiz? I am not sure. It just sounded better than \u0026ldquo;quiz\u0026quot;.\nMarketing, I suppose.\r\r\rThe Plan  \u0026ldquo;Fail to plan $\\implies$ Plan to fail\u0026rdquo;\n With this in mind, here is my plan:\n Learn some Javascript - this seems to be the most efficient way to run the application on my website, Develop the pub quiz design - what is the theme, the aesthetic, format, etc. of the quiz going to be? Create pub quiz assets - I envisage this will be the most time consuming step depending on the design. I will use Audacity to capture sound clips for instance. I\u0026rsquo;m undecided on other asset types - images, video clips, maps, quotes or even just multi-choice questions are all possible. Enhance the pub quiz application - metadata could be captured to create custom made quizes. An example would involve tagging actor names such that you could have an entire round on, say, Arnie films. Explore added features - a database backend to collect statistics and allow registration of users who could compete on high scores. Yes, probably too ambitious, hence an added (nice-to-have) feature to be developed at a much later stage (if ever).  A couple of concerns:\n Copyright - the sound assets are from copyrighted materials. I tried to read some Copyright law but quickly noted I was falling trap to premature optimisation, my usual mistake (as originally pointed here). For now my argument is fair use which YouTube summarises here albeit from a US legal standpoint. The sound assets are short clips (vast majority less than 15 seconds long) and my website is free to use. GitHub capacity - this website is hosted on GitHub as I\u0026rsquo;m too cheap to pay for my own hosting (although it would be nice to have my own URL). I wonder what the bandwidth that GitHub offers before they quietly ask me for some money to upgrade to a paid plan? Again, I will ignore this for now to avoid premature optimisation. Public nature - this website is open to anyone to visit. Some of the sound clips I have created contain strong language only suitable for adults (you know, a lot of good films are 18+ rated). I certainly do not want to have kids listening to this. I have no mechanism to control this and do not have time to investigate how to solve this problem. My initial thought is to include a consent pop-up window to confirm you are over 18. Another thought is to ensure all content is kid friendly.  Current Status The current (envisaged) status of the project:\n Learn some JavaScript Develop pub quiz design Create some pub quiz assets Capture metadata on pub quiz assets Launch alpha application Debug the horrible mess of an alpha application Deploy beta application for external testing to select users Crush the ridiculous bugs in the beta application to refine Launch the first release product Elicit feedback from end users Develop new requested features or give up and move onto something else  Project Log Below I sketch out the development over time. I understand this concept of typing out a project log is a bit outdated - there are tools out there to automate changelog generation but I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to research this further.\n  Day 1 - 26 April, 2020\n Not really day one so to speak as I\u0026rsquo;ve created some pub quiz assets already.\nI downloaded Audacity to create the sound clips. A few notes on my use of Audacity:\n I am currently on a Windows 10 machine. In Audacity I changed the settings to Windows WASAPI. This allows you to re-route the sound output as a microphone to record sounds. I experimented with a couple of settings:  Generate -\u0026gt; Tone: Can add a \u0026ldquo;bleep\u0026rdquo; type sound effect using a sine wave, Effect -\u0026gt; Amplify: Can either amplify or quieten a sound clip using this effect, Effect -\u0026gt; Vocal Reduction and Isolation: Occassionally I wanted to isolate the vocals from a music background heavy scene although I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the settings in this effect require finesse (which I do not possess) to make the clip sound passable afterwards.   I did not have the patience to work on anything else in Audacity. To save the clips I just exported as MP3 files There are a lot more features to Audacity but as a simple tool for this workflow it\u0026rsquo;s worked great and even a dummy like me had a semi-efficient process up and running quickly. Amazing software considering it is open source and free.  I also created this blog post to explain the idea and the plan to build it out into reality.\n Day 2 - 30 April, 2020\n I have now learnt how to embed HTML into my markdown files by using the in-built Hugo shortcode functionality. Within the HTML file I can reference this to an external JavaScript file (hosted in the static folder at the root directory).\nHTML code:\n\u0026lt;!-- demo canvas shortcode --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;canvas id=\u0026quot;demoCanvas\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;170\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;120\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;border:1px solid #000000;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\rA HTML canvas with width 170 and height 120 with a small black border filled in with a blue rectangle by calling an external JavaScript file.\r\u0026lt;/canvas\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;/js/democanvas.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r Note that anything written between the \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt; tag is not rendered if the user\u0026rsquo;s browser supports the \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt; tag. This is explained here in more detail.\nJavaScript code:\nconst canvas = document.getElementById('demoCanvas');\rconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\rctx.fillStyle = 'blue';\r// (x postion, y postion, width, height)\rctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);\r This generates the following output:\nA HTML canvas with width 170 and height 120 with a small black border filled in with a blue rectangle by calling an external javascript file.\r\r Basic but you have to start somewhere. 😄\n Day 3 - 06 May, 2020\n Found a very helpful GitHub repo and tutorial series to build a quiz app\n Learnt new shortcuts in VS Code for faster HTML prototyping ($ and . commands for id and class attributes respectively) Learnt the key concept in CSS is the box model (and that margins are collapsible) Was overwhelmed by JavaScript with an array of new topics:  \rArrow functions \rmap function The Promise object   Started to get to grips with JSON as a data structure You can fetch the external JavaScript file within the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; element without page loading performance issues by using the defer attribute in the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag.  Fixed the trailing whitespace \u0026ldquo;bug\u0026rdquo; when rendering markdown into HTML for URLs (see this discourse post for the fix and this blog post for how to overwrite theme template files (I use the Academic theme). However it looks like whitespace can still be rendered prior to the link if there is punctation immediately before - for example:\n ([Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/) renders as (\rSporcle)   Day 4 (to 6) - 10 May, 2020\n Project fatigue setting in. Skipping the JavaScript tutorials may have been a bad idea. Developing new features myself is proving that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I am doing and requires a painful amount of debugging. The cost? I have to imagine I will end up with spaghetti code if I continue with this development strategy.\nHere are a couple of concepts I am struggling with:\n Spread operator Whether the variable creates an object versus an array - objects do not have length properties so I have had trouble iterating over the elements (actually properties) within an object.  I am enjoying using the Chrome developer tools, particularly:\n console.log() functionality Device toolbar - noting how the website will display on different devices (including iOS devices)   Day 7 - 12 May, 2020\n Implemented some cosmetic fixes - highlighting the correct answer with a silly little CSS animation. So, is the pub quiz code any good? It works. Too many if statements for my liking and the use of a nested setTimeout() function call. Not great. Not terrible.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? I intend to add more functionality but over a longer time period. Additionally, I think it will be fun to write out more tailored pub quiz questions - this takes quite a bit of time (source material and writing up the questions \u0026amp; answers). For the time being I want to get back into Blender - perhaps I can create some neon pub quiz image assets? 😏\n","date":1587897614,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589318120,"objectID":"aaccf9abfa8bccbd903b8c547f65634c","permalink":"https://alexgarbiak.com/post/pub-quiz-idea/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T11:40:14+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/pub-quiz-idea/","section":"post","summary":"Background post to a new project I am working on to create a pub quiz app.","tags":["Web development"],"title":"The Garbiak Pub Quiz","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Personal"],"content":"Portfolio of renders I\u0026rsquo;ve created from Blender This page is a showcase of the Blender renders I\u0026rsquo;ve completed. The background to this is here. Over time this project will evolve into something more substantial.\nCurrent work (June 2020 - Week 2) I am on YouTube! \u0026ldquo;Why would you do this?\u0026quot; Easier faciliation of outputing Blender renders, particularly for video files (MPEG 4, encoded using the H.264 codec) which can grow in file size very quickly.\n  This week has been mostly working on an entire video composition from start to finish:\n Opening credits - The Matrix type effect is acheived using shading nodes only! This is entirely based on the work of CGMatter, truly awesome - generated using math (and a font set from dafont.com). Modelling the chess pieces - helps to have good reference images but these can be hard to trace. In the video I show the reference image I used. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell but it\u0026rsquo;s not strictly a side projection (there is some slight rotation). You can get some sense of sharp edges from the lighting effects on the reference image. The knight was the hardest piece to model. Shading the objects - kept this simple and used the default Principled BSDF node. World lighting - again kept this simple and used one of Blender\u0026rsquo;s default HDRI from within the material preview viewport shading. Finding a Chess Game to play out - I chose Kasparov\u0026rsquo;s Immortal game, it sounded cool and is highly rated in the Chess world. Animating the chess game - I soon realised this was going to be tedious. Blender allows you to write custom Python scripts which would make this process much more efficient. A few edge cases need to be considered though:  Pieces moving over each other (such as the Knight\u0026rsquo;s L shaped move - I opted for a quick z-axis lift) Piece taking another piece - here I opted for a vanishing act achieved using a z-axis fall Pawn upgrade - not shown in this sample video King checkmate - again not shown in thie sample video The other critical element is the camera placement and movement - I kept this simple, it\u0026rsquo;s not great and is a bit boring to be honest.   Finding some suitable music to go with the video images. I wanted to explore some copyright free music (simplistically works pre-1922 are in Public Domain) but you still have to be careful. Performances of Public Domains work are copyrighted to the performer. So my YouTube video was demonetized (I am not eligble for the YouTube partner program yet anywhere). I went with Erik Satie\u0026rsquo;s Gnossienne No. 1, performed by Alena Cherny. Using Blender\u0026rsquo;s Video Editing workflow to composite the various video clips and the audio file together. Very simple use of a fade transition. Not used this workflow before, looks pretty cool!  There is a lot of work left to do hence the title of a concept piece:\n Perhaps the most major blunder is the incorrect composition of the chessboard! The white Rook (position h1) should start on a white square. \u0026ldquo;Why not re-render?\u0026quot; you may ask. The reason is partially laziness, partially to move onto a new project and partially due to rendering times (roughly 30 minutes using the Eevee rendering engine). I ran out of time to complete the Chess Notation section (bottom right of the chess game animation) although I did find a nice Chess font from dafont.com.  Current work (June 2020 - Week 1) Finally decided to go back to basics and follow along with some beginner\u0026rsquo;s level tutorials. The one that has become a bit of meme amongst the Blender community, the \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; of renders, the donut. For those aspiring to start working with Blender I highly recommend Blender Guru\u0026rsquo;s tutorial series.\nHere are my creations:\n June 4, 2020 - Donut  Probably my best work so far. Icing is a little off with the wrapping around the donut. Probably can be fixed with some simple sculpting on the mesh. The displacement at the bottom of the donut may be too much - this will be a little tricky to fix as the displacement is achieved using a noise texture.\n\r\r\r June 3, 2020 - Teddy Bear  I suck with the sculpting tools in Blender. I want to blame the tools (I\u0026rsquo;m using a mouse rather than a pressure sensitive stylus) but really it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m rubbish. The main issue with this is the proportions are all wrong. The flooring texture (meant to be a nice wood floor) has been stretched so I ought have fiddled with the xyz scaling. The UV unwrapping for the teddy fabric is pretty awful because of bad topology. Other issues: too strong displacement has meant the nose texture has disappeared as well as the eyes sunk into the face. Finally I tried to create some nylon hair but it may be hidden within the displacement again.\n\r\r\r June 1 and 2, 2020 - Neon Sign  Main element that looks off here is the overpowering neon light against a brick texture backdrop. Again, I\u0026rsquo;ve messed up the power of the displacement - the bricks are popping out too much.\n\r\r\rPrior month work (May 2020) Currently working on character modelling, I\u0026rsquo;ve started simple, modelling the human eye: \nThe eyeball is currently the most lifelike aspect although the transmission material might be too strong: \nAs you may have noticed I switched out my boring corporate picture for a more fun Funko inspired 3D design.

I\u0026rsquo;ve never worked on computer graphics before but having now spent a week or so messing around in Blender, I have found it a lot of fun. I have learnt a few things along the way already:\n Blender is not something to do after work when trying to relax (I\u0026rsquo;ve found it stimulates the brain and is also quite addictive - let\u0026rsquo;s try one more thing is quite a common thought), Blender has an amazing community for beginners, YouTube tutorials are very easy to follow and the best place to start (learn the UI and pick up some shortcut keys), CG artists are incredibly talented and I am certainly just a hobbyist beginner, having some fun, If you\u0026rsquo;re dumb (like me) you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realise that Blender will try to perform any operation you ask of it - even if it totally destroys your hardware, thankfully the software is smart enough to just immediately crash. Lighting and camera placement (and movement for animations) make or break a scene. Two areas (amongst many) I need to work on.  So far I\u0026rsquo;ve explored Blender\u0026rsquo;s:\n Particle simulation, Rigid body physics, Cloth physics and Fluid physics for liquids (water) and gas (smoke).  I am intrigued by the soft body physics and may have a play with that next.\nIn terms of Blender channels I recommend the following:\n \rIan Hubert - his lazy tutorials are amusing and inspiring, \rDucky 3D - I have found his tutorials easy to follow with satisfying rendered output, \rCGMatter and Default Cube - CGMatter presents short and entertaining tutorial videos, often experimenting with his presentation style (not a fan of his short stint of ASMR tutorials). His alternative channel Default Cube has a more educational focus with longer, more detailed (better explained) tutorials. \u0026hellip; and many others \u0026hellip;  And finally I have to mention Beeple. The artwork by this CG artist is awesome, and the style is something I\u0026rsquo;d like to emulate within Blender (he seems to use Cinema 4D most of the time).\nJust for fun I\u0026rsquo;ll post a few Blender rendered images and animations here.

The idea was that I would write Rmarkdown posts about actuarial science (within the general insurance domain) featuring modelling results on theoretical concepts required to be learnt as part of the Institute\u0026rsquo;s exam syllabus.\nAs part of this I had been reading about blogdown which seemed promising and is very well documented. Unfortunately given the complex infrastructure behind the blogdown package (or perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s my excuse for just being dumb), I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get this to work in my preferred text editor, Visual Studio Code and having the output consistent with the theme I\u0026rsquo;m using (the Academic theme).1\nPerhaps an additional motiviation was that I enjoy learning new things and this seemed like a good challenge. This website was created in 2020. Around the same time I started to mess around with Blender - see this post for more details.\nI had previously only tried to build a website a couple of times before:\n Dabbling with Dreamweaver as a kid and not getting very far, Building a lottery based website, Warwick Accumulator Draw \u0026ldquo;WAD\u0026rdquo; as a university module, which was a lot of fun but a lot of work too. This was built back in early 2011 on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s .NET framework.  I also want to take this opportunity to pass on some career advice. This advice actually comes from my first boss Mike Froom who offered me a graduate trainee position at KPMG Birmingham (which was a great graduate job and would highly recommend). I must quickly add a disclaimer that the quote is paraphrased:\n \u0026ldquo;You should always challenge yourself by trying something new every six months.\u0026rdquo;\n Given the above, it felt like a reasonable challenge to get up and running with a modern day website. So how was this website built and how can you build your own website, for free, hosted on GitHub?\n How this site was built So how specifically was this website built? The truth is that it took a fair amount of trial and error and reading plenty of documentation. I am certainly no software developer so I hope this can give anyone the confidence that they can also build their own 100% free2 website.\nHere are the tools I\u0026rsquo;ve used to build this website:\n \rGit - download and install Git3 for free, \rHugo - pick your own operating system\u0026rsquo;s binary release for free, \rGitHub - set up your own GitHub account for free, \rAcademic Theme - fork the Academic Theme for free, \rVisual Studio Code - download and install Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s text editor for free,  The specific deployment to host on GitHub was based on documentation from Academic.\nOver time my specific setup has changed:\n I use Windows OS but use a bash terminal within VS Code. Wrote a shell script to automate deployment which works by:  Calling Hugo with no arguments, simply hugo, Copies the Hugo generated public folder (representing the entire static website) into a separate repo, Change directory to the other repo and commit the git changes locally, Push these to the remote (GitHub repo), Change back to the Hugo repo and delete the public folder.   Changes to layout and theming is performed at the root directory, not within the theme folder  URL registration Unfortunately garbiak.com was taken so I opted to register alexgarbiak.com as my custom URL. I am using Google Domains as the registrar of the domain. To link up the hosted content (on GitHub) with the URL I added a CNAME. Pretty straightforward with an annual fee payable of £10, seems reasonable. Some benefits of Google\u0026rsquo;s service:\n Access to Google\u0026rsquo;s DNS servers (fast and reliable you\u0026rsquo;d hope), Privacy (WHOIS), and 100 alias email addresses    The story doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. Here is some more commentary on the matter.\nBookdown is an excellent resource for anyone interested in R. Most resources on here are fully published books that are available, for free, in digital format. Specifically, my interest was piqued by the book hosted on here for the R package blogdown. The book advocates using Hugo to build your statically generated website.\nAs part of my work at Hiscox I occasionally work in R. My preferred IDE for such work is R Studio. R is fantastic for data - loading, transformation, analysis and visualisation. R Studio is the best IDE for working in R in my opinion. However, I personally find R Studio a little cumbersome for web development despite the existence of the blogdown package. Due to this I backtracked somewhat to read up on Hugo documentation. Here I discovered the Academic theme, which largely powers the user experience on this website. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Free as in no monetary purchase is required. However as with everything in life, there are some restrictions. All the tools listed come with a variant of an open-source license (GNU General Public License, Apache, MIT, et. al.) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n It\u0026rsquo;s pretty terrible I only came across Git in late 2019. I am still yet to make use of its extensive functionality, but already consider it the most important tool within development. There are plenty of good tutorials you can Google for more help and the git-scm website is the reference guide. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1580512321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592167276,"objectID":"33f725baa2e4cc22249c97ef889b418d","permalink":"https://alexgarbiak.com/post/building-this-site/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T23:12:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/building-this-site/","section":"post","summary":"Background and incomplete post of how this website was started.","tags":["Web development"],"title":"How I built this website","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Your privacy is important to me.

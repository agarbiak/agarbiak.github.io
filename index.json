Quizzes are easy to create but hard to be fun. So here goes my attempt at building a pub quiz application using Javascript so I can host it on my own website.\n\rWhy a pub quiz? I am not sure. It just sounded better than \u0026ldquo;quiz\u0026quot;. Marketing, I suppose.\r\r\rThe Plan  Fail to plan =\u0026gt; Plan to fail\n With this in mind, here is my plan:\n Learn some Javascript - this seems to be the most efficient way to run the application on my website but I have yet to write any Javascript (a post for the future), Develop the pub quiz design - what is the theme, the aesthetic, format, etc. of the quiz going to be? Create pub quiz assets - I envisage this will be the most time consuming step depending on the design. I will use Audacity to capture sound clips for instance. I\u0026rsquo;m undecided on other asset types - images, video clips, maps, quotes or even just multi-choice questions are all possible. Enhance the pub quiz application - metadata could be captured to create custom made quizes. An example would involve tagging actor names such that you could have an entire round on, say, Arnie films. Explore added features - a database backend to collect statistics and allow registration of users who could compete on high scores. Yes, probably too ambitious, hence an added (nice-to-have) feature to be developed at a much later stage (if ever).  A couple of concerns:\n Copyright - the sound assets are from copyrighted materials. I tried to read some Copyright law but quickly noted I was falling trap to premature optimisation\r, my usual mistake (as originally pointed here\r). For now my argument is fair use which YouTube helpfully summarises here\ralbeit from a US legal standpoint. The sound assets are short clips (vast majority less than 15 seconds long) and my website is free to use. GitHub capacity - this website is hosted on GitHub as I\u0026rsquo;m too cheap to pay for my own hosting (although it would be nice to have my own URL). I wonder what the bandwidth that GitHub offers before they quietly ask me for some money to upgrade to a paid plan? Again, I will ignore this for now to avoid premature optimisation\r. Public nature - this website is open to anyone to visit. Some of the sound clips I have created contain strong language only suitable for adults (you know, a lot of good films are 18+ rated). I certainly do not want to kids listening to this. I have no mechanism to control this and do not have time to investigate how to solve this problem. My initial thought is to include a consent pop-up window to confirm you are over 18. Another thought is to ensure all content is kid friendly.  And one more thing\r, I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out yet how Markdown renders URL links (like the \u0026ldquo;one more thing\u0026rdquo; Colombo clip) but I have noticed the annoying rendered whitespace that trail after my links. It is annoying and something I want to fix in the future.\nCurrent Status The current (envisaged) status of the project:\n Learn some Javascript Develop pub quiz design Create some pub quiz assets Capture metadata on pub quiz assets Launch alpha application Debug the horrible mess of an alpha application Deploy beta application for external testing to select users Crush the ridiculous bugs in the beta application to refine Launch the first release product Elicit feedback from end users Develop new requested features or give up and move onto something else  Project Log You must be either really bored or have a curious mind if you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far into this post. To be honest given .md files are just plain text files, with Git the concept of a project log is a bit pointless. I have not investigated this but I suspect others have created project logs using a history of Git commits with any software development project. I just looked, this already exists, see this repo\ras an example. For now I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy and have too much going on to research further. I\u0026rsquo;ll just write down the development manually here on this page.\n  Day 1 - 26 April, 2020\n Not really day one so to speak as I\u0026rsquo;ve created some pub quiz assets already.\nI downloaded Audacity\rto create the sound clips. A few notes on my use of Audacity:\n I am currently on a Windows 10 machine. In Audacity I changed the settings to Windows WASAPI. This allows you to re-route the sound output as a microphone to record sounds. I experimented with a couple of settings:  Generate -\u0026gt; Tone: Can add a \u0026ldquo;bleep\u0026rdquo; type sound effect using a sine wave, Effect -\u0026gt; Amplify: Can either amplify or quieten a sound clip using this effect, Effect -\u0026gt; Vocal Reduction and Isolation: Occassionally I wanted to isolate the vocals from a music background heavy scene although I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the settings in this effect require finesse (which I do not possess) to make the clip sound passable afterwards.   I did not have the patience to work on anything else in Audacity. To save the clips I just exported as MP3 files There are a lot more features to Audacity but as a simple tool for this workflow it\u0026rsquo;s worked great and even a dummy like me had a semi-efficient process up and running quickly. Amazing software considering it is open source and free.  I also created this blog post to explain the idea and the plan to build it out into reality.\n Day 2 - 30 April, 2020\n I have now learnt how to embed HTML into my markdown files by using the in-built Hugo shortcode\rfunctionality. Within the HTML file I can reference this to an external javascript file (hosted in the static folder at the root directory).\nHTML code:\n\u0026lt;!-- demo canvas shortcode --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;canvas id=\u0026quot;demoCanvas\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;170\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;120\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;border:1px solid #000000;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\rA HTML canvas with width 170 and height 120 with a small black border filled in with a blue rectangle by calling an external javascript file.\r\u0026lt;/canvas\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;/js/democanvas.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r Note that anything written between the \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt; tag is not rendered if the user\u0026rsquo;s browser supports the \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt; tag. This is explained here\rin more detail.\nJavascript code:\nconst canvas = document.getElementById('demoCanvas');\rconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\rctx.fillStyle = 'blue';\r// (x postion, y postion, width, height)\rctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);\r This generates the following output:\nA HTML canvas with width 170 and height 120 with a small black border filled in with a blue rectangle by calling an external javascript file.\r\r Basic but you have to start somewhere ðŸ˜„.\n","date":1587897614,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588331625,"objectID":"aaccf9abfa8bccbd903b8c547f65634c","permalink":"https://agarbiak.github.io/post/pub-quiz-idea/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T11:40:14+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/pub-quiz-idea/","section":"post","summary":"Background post to a new project I am working on to create a pub quiz app.","tags":["Web development"],"title":"The Garbiak Pub Quiz","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Personal"],"content":"Portfolio of renders I\u0026rsquo;ve created from Blender This page is a showcase of the Blender renders I\u0026rsquo;ve completed.

I\u0026rsquo;ve never worked on computer graphics before but having now spent a week or so messing around in Blender, I have found it a lot of fun. I have learnt a few things along the way already:\n Blender is not something to do after work when trying to relax (I\u0026rsquo;ve found it stimulates the brain and is also quite addictive - let\u0026rsquo;s try one more thing is quite a common thought), Blender has an amazing community for beginners, YouTube tutorials are very easy to follow and the best place to start (learn the UI and pick up some shortcut keys), CG artists are incredibly talented and I am certainly just a hobbyist beginner, having some fun, If you\u0026rsquo;re dumb (like me) you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realise that Blender will try to perform any operation you ask of it - even if it totally destroys your hardware, thankfully the software is smart enough to just immediately crash. Lighting and camera placement (and movement for animations) make or break a scene. Two areas (amongst many) I need to work on.  So far I\u0026rsquo;ve explored Blender\u0026rsquo;s:\n Particle simulation, Rigid body physics, Cloth physics and Fluid physics for liquids (water) and gas (smoke).  I am intrigued by the soft body physics and may have a play with that next.\nIn terms of Blender channels I recommend the following:\n \rIan Hubert\r- his lazy tutorials are amusing and inspiring, \rDucky 3D\r- I have found his tutorials easy to follow with satisfying rendered output, \rCGMatter\rand Default Cube\r- CGMatter presents short and entertaining tutorial videos, often experimenting with his presentation style (not a fan of his short stint of ASMR\rtutorials). His alternative channel Default Cube has a more educational focus with longer, more detailed (better explained) tutorials. \u0026hellip; and many others \u0026hellip;  And finally I have to mention Beeple.\rThe artwork by this CG artist is awesome, and the style is something I\u0026rsquo;d like to emulate within Blender (he seems to use Cinema 4D most of the time).\nJust for fun I\u0026rsquo;ll post a few Blender rendered images and animations here. Time pending, I plan to expand this out to longer animations which I think will be hosted on YouTube so that I can continue to host this website for free on GitHub (storing massive mpeg4 files may hit a storage cap on GitHub, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into it yet).\n","date":1583066779,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587906028,"objectID":"4f1cc22fdfdda511a0b28f2b9be55636","permalink":"https://agarbiak.github.io/post/blender/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T12:46:19Z","relpermalink":"/post/blender/","section":"post","summary":"Background post of why I started to use Blender to satisfy a new interest in CGI.","tags":["Blender"],"title":"Blender - Open Source Computer Graphics","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Personal"],"content":"For those who have no time, I summarise as:\n Reading documentation from blogdown,\r A fair amount of trial and error, and, Plenty of frustration (aka debugging).  \rThis post is not yet complete and perhaps never will be. I believe one of my key weaknesses (I have many) is premature optimisation and so I have posted this as-is. To prove this point - consider the last modified date and look at the Github repo for a history of this page.\r\r\rThe inspiration for this site I don\u0026rsquo;t recall the motivation to build this website other than following on from a quote (potentially misquoted as from memory from over five years ago) from the very first professional interview I had with Mike Froom\rwhen I was applying for graduate employment at KPMG Birmingham:\r \u0026ldquo;You should always challenge yourself by trying something new every six months.\u0026rdquo;\n I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much of this at the time but having spent nearly ten years in employment I do think this is good advice. Whilst I no longer work for KPMG,\rI do reflect fondly on the experience as an excellent well-rounded UK graduate opportunity.\rSo how was this website built and how can you build your own website, for free, hosted on GitHub?\rWhat follows is an insight into how I came to build this website.\n Bookdown\r- an R\rpackage that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown. \rBookdown\ris an excellent resource for anyone interested in R.\rMost resources on here are fully published books that are available, for free, in digital format. Specifically, my interest was piqued by the book\rhosted on here for the R package blogdown.\rPlease consider supporting the authors here.\rAs an aside, I spent some time delving into one of the author\u0026rsquo;s\rpersonal struggles he faced when transitioning from academia to industry which I found quite insightful. Here is the link to his blog post on the subject.\rThe book\radvocates using Hugo\rto build your statically generated website. I\u0026rsquo;ve only tried to build a website twice before this:\n Dabbling with Dreamweaver\ras a kid and not getting very far, Building a lottery based website, Warwick Accumulator Draw \u0026ldquo;WAD\u0026rdquo;\ras a university module, which was a lot of fun but a lot of work too. This was built back in early 2011 on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s .NET framework.\r  As part of my work at Hiscox\rI occasionally work in R.\rMy preferred IDE for such work is R Studio.\rR is fantastic for data - loading, transformation and analysis and R Studio is the best IDE for working in R in my opinion. However, I personally find R Studio a little cumbersome for web development despite the existence of the excellent blogdown\rpackage. Due to this I backtracked somewhat to read up on Hugo\rdocumentation. Here I discovered the Academic\rtheme, which as of January 2020, largely powers the user experience on this website.\n How this site was built So how specifically was this website built? The truth is that it took a fair amount of trial and error and reading plenty of documentation. I am certainly no software developer so I hope this can give anyone the confidence that they can also build their own 100% free website.\nHere are the tools I\u0026rsquo;ve used to build this website:\n \rGit\r- download and install Git for free (subject to the GNU General Public License\rversion 2.0), \rHugo\r- pick your own operating system\u0026rsquo;s binary release for free (subject to the Apache\rLicense version 2.0), \rGitHub\r- set up your own GitHub account for free, \rAcademic Theme\r- fork the Academic Theme for free (subject to the MIT\rlicense), \rVisual Studio Code\r- download and install Microsoft Corporation\u0026rsquo;s Visual Studio Code for free (subject to the MIT\rlicense),  The specific deployment to host on GitHub\rwas based on documentation from Academic.\rHere is my specific setup on my Windows OS:\n Use OneDrive for the Hugo binary in: /Hugo/bin, Use OneDrive to host my local repo across my PC and my laptop within /Hugo/Sites, This local repo mirrors my privately hosted GitHub (\u0026ldquo;remote\u0026rdquo;) repo that contains the source code to build the website, Add content in Visual Studio Code,\rusing Git commands to add, commit and push to remote any changes, Using the Git bash command \u0026ldquo;hugo\u0026rdquo;, I re-build my website to populate the /public sub-directory, Clone my built website in a local repo within OneDrive/Hugo/Sites/\u0026ldquo;website-name\u0026rdquo; so that I can Git commit changes on each re-build, Copy-paste the contents of the /public sub-directory, add to Git, commit and push to remote,\r Using the Git bash command \u0026ldquo;rm -rf public\u0026rdquo; within the local repo, I delete the /public sub-directory, Repeat the above steps for publishing new content.  This deployment workflow was based on documentation within Academic.\r I\u0026rsquo;ve only used Git\rfor a few months, have barely scratched the surface of its power, but already consider it the most important tool anyone should use for any development. Perhaps it deserves its own post in the future.\nEven newer than this is my use of Visual Studio Code\rwhich I consider a fantastic text editor. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, free, includes Git integration, has syntax highlighting and the UI just makes sense (e.g. the explorer side-panel for your directory tree).\n","date":1580512321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587906081,"objectID":"33f725baa2e4cc22249c97ef889b418d","permalink":"https://agarbiak.github.io/post/building-this-site/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T23:12:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/building-this-site/","section":"post","summary":"Background and incomplete post of how this website was started.","tags":["Web development","Git","Hugo"],"title":"How I built this website","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Your privacy is important to me.

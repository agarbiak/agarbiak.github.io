Whilst I no longer work for KPMG,\rI do reflect fondly on the experience as an excellent well-rounded UK graduate opportunity.\rSo how was this website built and how can you build your own website, for free, hosted on GitHub?\rWhat follows is an insight into how I came to build this website.\n Bookdown\r- an R\rpackage that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown. \rBookdown\ris an excellent resource for anyone interested in R.\rMost resources on here are fully published books that are available, for free, in digital format. Specifically, my interest was piqued by the book\rhosted on here for the R package blogdown.\rPlease consider supporting the authors here.\rAs an aside, I spent some time delving into one of the author\u0026rsquo;s\rpersonal struggles he faced when transitioning from academia to industry which I found quite insightful. Here is the link to his blog post on the subject.\rThe book\radvocates using Hugo\rto build your statically generated website. I\u0026rsquo;ve only tried to build a website twice before this:\n Dabbling with Dreamweaver\ras a kid and not getting very far, Building a lottery based website, Warwick Accumulator Draw \u0026ldquo;WAD\u0026rdquo;\ras a university module, which was a lot of fun but a lot of work too. This was built back in early 2011 on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s .NET framework.\r  As part of my work at Hiscox\rI occasionally work in R.\rMy preferred IDE for such work is R Studio.\rR is fantastic for data - loading, transformation and analysis and R Studio is the best IDE for working in R in my opinion. However, I personally find R Studio a little cumbersome for web development despite the existence of the excellent blogdown\rpackage. Due to this I backtracked somewhat to read up on Hugo\rdocumentation. Here I discovered the Academic\rtheme, which as of January 2020, largely powers the user experience on this website.\n How this site was built So how specifically was this website built? The truth is that it took a fair amount of trial and error and reading plenty of documentation. I am certainly no software developer so I hope this can give anyone the confidence that they can also build their own 100% free website.\nHere are the tools I\u0026rsquo;ve used to build this website:\n \rGit\r- download and install Git for free (subject to the GNU General Public License\rversion 2.0), \rHugo\r- pick your own operating system\u0026rsquo;s binary release for free (subject to the Apache\rLicense version 2.0), \rGitHub\r- set up your own GitHub account for free, \rAcademic Theme\r- fork the Academic Theme for free (subject to the MIT\rlicense), \rVisual Studio Code\r- download and install Microsoft Corporation\u0026rsquo;s Visual Studio Code for free (subject to the MIT\rlicense),  The specific deployment to host on GitHub\rwas based on documentation from Academic.\rHere is my specific setup on my Windows OS:\n Use OneDrive for the Hugo binary in: /Hugo/bin, Use OneDrive to host my local repo across my PC and my laptop within /Hugo/Sites, This local repo mirrors my privately hosted GitHub (\u0026ldquo;remote\u0026rdquo;) repo that contains the source code to build the website, Add content in Visual Studio Code,\rusing Git commands to add, commit and push to remote any changes, Using the Git bash command \u0026ldquo;hugo\u0026rdquo;, I re-build my website to populate the /public sub-directory, Clone my built website in a local repo within OneDrive/Hugo/Sites/\u0026ldquo;website-name\u0026rdquo; so that I can Git commit changes on each re-build, Copy-paste the contents of the /public sub-directory, add to Git, commit and push to remote,\r Using the Git bash command \u0026ldquo;rm -rf public\u0026rdquo; within the local repo, I delete the /public sub-directory, Repeat the above steps for publishing new content.  This deployment workflow was based on documentation within Academic.\r I\u0026rsquo;ve only used Git\rfor a few months, have barely scratched the surface of its power, but already consider it the most important tool anyone should use for any development. Perhaps it deserves its own post in the future.\nEven newer than this is my use of Visual Studio Code\rwhich I consider a fantastic text editor. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, free, includes Git integration, has syntax highlighting and the UI just makes sense (e.g. the explorer side-panel for your directory tree).\n","date":1580512321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580512321,"objectID":"33f725baa2e4cc22249c97ef889b418d","permalink":"https://agarbiak.github.io/post/building-this-site/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T23:12:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/building-this-site/","section":"post","summary":"For those who have no time, I summarise as:\n Reading documentation from blogdown,\r A fair amount of trial and error, and, Plenty of frustration (aka debugging).  \rThis post is not yet complete and perhaps never will be.
